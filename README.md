CS 360 Portfolio Reflection

We had to design and build an Android inventory management software that lets users make an account, log in, manage their inventory items, and optionally get SMS notifications. The program was made to satisfy the demand for easy inventory tracking without an internet connection using a local SQLite database.

The program has a login screen, an inventory screen where you can add and remove goods, and it can handle SMS permissions. The UI was made to be easy to use and understand, with clear input fields, buttons, and logical navigation to encourage user-centered design.

I worked on development step by step, starting with the UI and then adding features with distinct activities and a database assist class. I utilized SQLite for long-term storage and made sure the code was easy to read by using consistent naming conventions and in-line comments.

We used the Android Emulator to test the login feature, database persistence, inventory updates, and SMS permission handling. This procedure made sure that the software worked properly for different types of users.

One thing I did really well was set up the database and inventory CRUD operations, which showed that I knew how to store data and connect with activities on Android.
